            Organised by TNHSP and IIT Madras, The Emergency Services Hackathon
            brings you the opportunity to innovate and have a positive impact on the current
             structure of the 108 Emergency Services in Tamil Nadu .</p>
          <p>
            In case of any emergency, rapid intervention is critical in determining the outcome.
            The emergency service personnel have the
             crucial responsibility of bringing the response time to as minimal as possible.
             But, due to the limited information an emergency personnel can gather over phone
             the response times are high. Most of the times, it is very hard to locate the
             area where emergency situation has arised, just from the descriptions that
             are provided over call. The person who is calling 108 might be new to the place and
             might not be able to describe the address accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
          Innovations in technology can play an integral part in achieving this goal.
           The aim of this hackathon is to come up with solutions that leverage the
           capabilities of a smart phone and integrate them with the backend
           infrastructure at the Call-Centre to make the flow of information fast
           and seamless thereby greatly increasing the efficiency.

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 center text-center">
        <p>The 108 Emergency Ambulance Service is a 24x7 service, which anyone
          can avail by dialling the number 108 on their phone during the case of any
          emergency. It could be either a medical emergency, a fire emergency, or a crime
          being committed. The number 108 is a toll-free number and can be dialed from
          any phone, be it a mobile phone or a landline, at the time of an emergency,
          without any prefix or suffix.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is currently operational in 20 states (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar,
          Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,
          Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana,
          Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) and two Union Territories (Dadra & Nagar Haveli
          and Daman & Diu.)
        </p>
        <p>Initially, the person who receives the call at Emergency Response
          Centre (ERC) takes down the nature of emergency and the location of the caller.
          Depending on the nature of the call, either an ambulance, a fire engine, or a
          police assistance is sent. This is done through the Emergency Response Centre.
        </p>
        <p>The centralized Emergency Response Centre helps coordinate between
          the Despatch Officer, Emergency Response Centre Physician and the Emergency
          Medical Technician (EMT) for getting guidance during transit. Coordination with police
          and fire department is also facilitated through the Emergency Response Centre.
          The entire service is free for any citizen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            The theme / problem statement for this hackathon is to develop
            applications that will help <i>108 Emergency Services</i> to locate the
            caller, and dispatch help as quickly as possible.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          When an emergency is reported through 108, the call taker gathers
          the needed basic information and dispatches appropriate services.
          Basic information obtained includes:
          <ul style="text-align:left;margin: 10px;">
            <li>Where the call is placed from ( district / taluk /city / town / exact location / landmark )</li>
            <li>The type of emergency</li>
            <li>Number of people injured and the condition of the injured</li>
            <li>The caller's name and contact number – for location guidance if required</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          But, what happens most of the times is that the person who is calling 108
          will be under trauma due to the emergency situation they may be in and
          might not be able to explain these details clearly, especially the location.
          Another common issue
          is that the person does not know their exact location. They might be new to the place,
          might be on a highway, there might not even be a visible landmark to nearby.
          How can the centralized Emergency Response Centre get exact location of the caller?
        </p>
        <p>
          This will make it difficult for the dispatcher to assess the situation and send
          help as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after the dispatcher figure out where the location is, they have to pass the information
          on to the nearest ambulance / help center. Even though ambulance centers are available at many
          places, it is crucial to choose the nearest available one. This is done manually now, by looking at
          a list of base stations. Each minute spent in deciding where to dispatch the
          call might cost lives.
          There might be an ambulance on road nearby, not at the base station,
          but the call center might not be aware of it.
          How can the centralized Emergency Response Centre get exact location of all ambulances and
          choose the right one to send to the emergency location?
        </p>
        <p>
          When an ambulance gets a call, they will only know the location provided by the caller,
          passed on by the call center. With this limited information, ambulance driver needs to
          find where the caller is exactly as quickly as possible. Even though they have the approximate
          location, there might be traffic on the road and they might not be aware of a faster
          alternate route.
          How can the ambulance driver get exact location of the emergency and reach there in the
          minimum amount of time?
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the caller, after they have made the call and got confirmation that help is going to arrive,
          they have no further idea of when help is going to come. This could further complicate
          situtaions.
          How can the caller know when help is going to arrive?
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          The ultimate aim of this hackathon is to use smartphone and internet based technologies
          to provide realistic solution to the questions mentioned above (and beyond). For e.g. if there is an
          app that can send the exact GPS coordinates of the caller to the Emergency Response Centre, it will become
          very easy to identify the place and quickly send the nearest ambulance. If the exact location of
          ambulances are also known, the system could calculate the time required by each of them to
          reach the destination and allocate the optimal one, which would reach in the shortest amount of time.
          It will be easy for the call center personnel to identify and make sense of everything if all these
          details are shown on a realtime map on screen.
          If the ambulance driver has something like Google Maps, he could navigate to the exact location
          without any trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the kind of solutions we are looking for. Remember, the soultions has to be realistic and
          has to be implemented. The winner's solutions could be directly adopted by the 108 Emergency Services. So,
          this would be a great opportunity to have an impact on millions of lives.
        </p>

            Collecting data and developing algorithms for analytics on the data
            collected is also encouraged.
            Any other aspect of innovation above and beyond the aforementioned,
            in the theme of emergency services are appreciated.
